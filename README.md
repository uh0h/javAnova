# javAnova
Armstrong Techfest project

JavaFX GUI application that runs

1) One-way ANOVA test for three samples using the F distribution. Contains a pie chart for visualizing significant differences in means.

2) Tukey's Post Hoc test using the Q distribution to show significant differences between means. Includes a bar graph that helps visualize signifcant Q values.

3) Scheffe's Post Hoc test using the F distribution to show significant differences in contrasts between means.

javAnova also includes the ability to import and save data from TXT and CSV files.

Plans for the future:
1) Box and whisker plot will replace the pie chart.
2) Be able to test more than three samples.
3) Be able to test two-way ANOVA and three-way ANOVA with interactions. (And maybe beyond.)
4) Change TableView to SpreadsheetView. (Maybe from controlsFX)
5) Allow copy/paste from java to other documents of ANOVA tables and graphs.
5) Include linear regression, X^2 tests, and much much more.
